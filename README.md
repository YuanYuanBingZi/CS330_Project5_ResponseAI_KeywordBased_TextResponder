# CS330_Project5_ResponseAI_KeywordBased_TextResponder
This project creates an AI that reads a list of keywords and messages, then responds based on keyword matches. Depending on the mood (happy or angry), the AI gives different responses, which are saved to an output file. The focus is on implementing mood-based responses using object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.
